"""Turn written script into speakable script.

The scripts in frontend/js/output.js are written to be READ ON A CARD. Spoken
aloud, the same text has defects that are invisible on screen and obvious in
your ears — and they are most of what makes a synthetic read sound synthetic.
Every rule here came from looking at real output (reel 1, esds-software-solution,
28 Aug 2026) rather than from imagining what might go wrong:

    देता है।।        a DOUBLE danda. Reads as a broken double stop.
    ₹408             symbol before the number; Hindi and Telugu speak the
                     currency AFTER it ("चार सौ आठ रुपये", not "रुपया 408").
    ₹720 करोड़       the unit sits between the amount and the currency word,
                     so a naive swap gives "720 रुपये करोड़".
    100%             the glyph is either skipped or read in English.
    01 सितंबर        a leading zero becomes "zero one".

WHAT THIS DELIBERATELY DOES NOT DO
----------------------------------
No number-to-words. In Devanagari and Telugu context the v3 models read digit
strings in the right language already, and a hand-rolled Hindi/Telugu numbering
system (लाख / करोड़, gendered forms, decimals) is a large surface with a bad
failure mode: silently saying the wrong figure about somebody's money. If the
ear test shows digits being misread, that is the moment to add it — with the
model's actual mistakes in hand.

Nor does it rewrite content. `₹0 करोड़` is a SCRIPT defect, not a pronunciation
one — the fix is for output.js to not emit the clause at all — so it is reported
by `problems()` and left alone here. Silently deleting a figure would be the
worst of both.

    The governing idea, and it is the opposite of the obvious one: STABILITY
    RISES WITH NUMERIC DENSITY. Low stability is what lets v3 act, but it also
    lets it improvise — and on a line that is mostly figures, "expressive" means
    a real risk of speaking a different number than the card is showing. That is
    not a delivery flaw, it is a false statement about somebody's money.

    argument rather than readout gets the latitude, because there is nothing in
    it to get factually wrong. Questions are the marker for the second kind.
